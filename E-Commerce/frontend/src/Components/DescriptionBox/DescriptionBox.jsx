          An ecommerce website is an online store where customers can find
          products, browse offerings, and place purchases online. It facilitates
          the transaction between a buyer and seller. A digital storefront can
          serve as the virtual equivalent of the product shelves, sales staff,
          and cash register of a physical shop.

          e-commerce websites typically display products or services along with
          detailed descriptions, prices, images, and sometimes customer reviews,
          to help customers make informed purchasing decisions.
